A small image gallery application written in Python using Django and the jQuery JavaScript library.  It is very alpha at the moment and not recommended for use yet.

Installation instructions:

* Assuming Django is installed and a project already exists.
  - Requires admin auto discover setup for the project.
  - Requires PIL, Python Image Library
  - Requires MEDIA_ROOT set in settings.py

1. Download and add the dali directory to your Python path.

2. Add `dali` to your INSTALLED_APPS setting in Django.

3. Configure your webserver to serve the 'dali/static' directory for the '/static/.*' URLs.  For example, to have Django's server handle them during development this in urls.py:

(r'^static/(?P<path>.*)$', 'serve', {'document_root': '/path/to/dali/static'}),

4. Run `manage.py syncdb` from your Django project.

Then you should be ready to go.
