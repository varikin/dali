A small blogging/gallery site in django.  Very alpha and not working at the moment.  It uses the jQuery javascript library.

The following enviroment variables need to be set:

PYTHONPATH=/Path/to/top/level/blag:/Path/to/django/settings/directory
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings

PYTHONPATH should be set to the top level blag directory and the 
directory that contains the django settings file and url file.  
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE needs to be set to the name of the django 
settings file without the .py extension.  This is settings or 
settings.py by default, but can named anything.

For example, I have the following directories:

$ ls /Users/varikin/code/blag
LICENSE      README       example-conf templates
NOTICE       blag         static

$ ls /Users/varikin/code/djangosettings/
django.db    settings.py  urls.py

And the following enviroment variables:

 $ echo $PYTHONPATH
/Users/varikin/code/blag/:/Users/varikin/code/djangosettings/:

 $ echo $DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
settings
